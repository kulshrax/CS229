"THE DRUDGE REPORT\\n\\n\\n\\nYou won't see this story on foxfag forum because they suck bIacks and gay 0bama all the way to the crack.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn Tuesday Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the House committee on \\nOversight and Government Reform, took a major step toward holding \\nAttorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for his failure to \\nprovide subpoenaed documents and other information about Operation Fast \\nand Furious.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a Jan. 31 letter, Issa had threatened Holder with such a move if he \\nfailed to provide all the subpoenaed documents relating to the Fast and \\nFurious gunwalking scandal by Feb. 9. That deadline has come and gone, \\nand Holder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Department of Justice still hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t provided most of those \\ndocuments. Issa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subpoena dates back to Oct. 12, 2011.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn Tuesday in a seven-page letter, Issa revealed that Deputy Attorney \\nGeneral James Cole begged Congress to extend the Feb. 9 deadline. Issa \\nwrote that the request was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cironic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cignores the reality that the \\nDepartment has unreasonably delayed producing these documents to the \\nCommittee.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn its face, the requested extension demonstrates a lack of good \\nfaith,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Issa wrote to Holder. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith one exception, the Department has \\nonly produced documents responsive to the subpoena on the eve of \\ncongressional hearings in which senior Department officials testified. \\nThe Department appears to be more concerned with protecting its image \\nthrough spin control than actually cooperating with Congress.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe cannot wait any longer for the Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cooperation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Issa \\ncontinued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs such, please specify a date by which you expect the \\nDepartment to produce all documents responsive to the subpoena. In \\naddition, please specify a Department representative who will interface \\nwith the Committee for production purposes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\nIssa added that whoever Holder designates as the go-to DOJ official for \\ndelivering subpoenaed documents \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshould also serve as the conduit for \\ndealing with the contempt proceedings, should the Department continue to\\n ignore the Committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subpoena.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (RELATED: Full coverage of Eric \\nHolder)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe California Republican slammed Holder, too, for claiming the \\ncongressional investigation into Fast and Furious was a political game \\nfor Republicans.\\n\\n\\n\\nRead more: http://dailycaller.com/2012/02/14/issa-takes-step-toward-holding-holder-in-contempt-of-congress/#ixzz1mQNF3g00\\n\\n\\n\\n"
