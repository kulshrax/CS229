Lying and Perverting the course of Justice are two completely different things which can't be used interchangably - it doesn't even matter what you say unless you are under arrest at the time as it is the actual arrest that gives them the power to repeat what you have said in court. As in "You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention something you later rely on in court. anything YOU DO SAY may be taken and given in evidence". So unless the passengers were arrested for your non-existant crime and then agreed to give a statement against the driver who was doing them a favour, who would then subsequently have to have admitted all wrongdoing in front of a judge.\n\nIt isn't more likely than I think, it's probably even less likely than I think"

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had determined that the real estate finance firm and others like it were \\xe2\\x80\\x9cscams\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the congresswoman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s measure would have overturned a federal ban that would have allowed the shady enterprises to keep raking in lucrative profits..For years the firms acted as a middleman to help sellers finance down payments so that low-income buyers could qualify for mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The lobbyist who paid Waters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 husband represented the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest such middleman (Sacrament-based Nehemiah Corp.), which stood to lose hundreds of millions of dollars if the ban wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reversed by friendly lawmakers like Waters. .Implemented in 2008, the federal ban was never overturned but not for lack of effort on Waters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 part. The ten-term congresswoman sponsored legislation three times to stop the ban or repeal it once it became law. She claims she did it because the program allowed hundreds of thousands of low-income families to become homeowners. .News of this latest scandal comes as the House Ethics Committee prepares to try Waters for using her influence to steer $12 million in federal bailout funds to a failing bank (that subsequently got shut down by the government) in which she and her board member husband held shares. .A few months ago the congresswoman got in trouble again for skirting federal elections rules with a crooked fundraising gimmick that allows her to receive unlimited amounts of donations from certain contributors. Instead of raising most of her campaign funds from individuals and political action committees, Waters sells her endorsement to other politicians and political causes for as much as $45,000 a pop, allowing her to rake in hundreds of thousands of dollars in short periods of time. **************Neil Goldschmidt \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Democrat \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Oregon governor.

">A fully reserved Tyranid army built right can indeed exploit the current Internet meta lists.\\n\\nHow? You make this claim several times but don\\'t present any kind of strategy, evidence, or anything else. How are you "exploiting the meta"? How does the army deal with mechanized lists and mobile armies?\\n\\n>The long answer is yes but it will require near perfect play and some degree of luck.\\n\\nWhy do you feel that a reserve army with perfect play/good luck can beat top tier lists, but other armies cannot? What makes it more effective in this regard?\\n\\n>I\\'ve also noticed that kill points are not often chosen as a primary \\nobjective at other events such as those that use the P/S/T format\\n\\nI can\\'t speak for your experience, but most such events that I\\'ve seen have three objectives that are randomly allocated priority, making KP no more or less common than the others. Moreover, giving up KP is hardly the main disadvantage of the list; others rank much more significantly.\\n\\n> Note that roughly 75 percent of your army should arrive during the second turn\\n\\n:| Math, huh?\\n\\n>Many of the units in my army are fast due to fleet so I can quickly redeploy much of my army as the game progresses\\n\\nFleet doesn\\'t make you any faster than anything else. Other infantry can Run, and tanks are flat-out faster than you thanks to being able to move 12" automatically rather than hoping for a good roll.\\n\\n> Imperial Guard armies heavily rely upon their Chimeras to protect their\\n scoring units so you want to prioritize targeting their transports...\\n\\nAgain, how do you actually kill transports? The lists you present usually feature very little AT. Your Zoanthropes and Trygon are the only units that will be able to consistently kill tanks.\\n\\n>At the end of the day though the results are the same\\xe2\\x80\\x94no major wins for \\nTyranids in fifth edition at any big events and I don\\'t believe that is \\ngoing to change while fifth edition is still in effect.\\n\\nEntirely true- at this point, I don\\'t think that Tyranids are likely to take any major events, as too many factors are stacked against them. It\\'s not impossible to win with them, but especially in environments where mech lists are common they will struggle. So do you really think that your own list is going to be able to achieve this- that you\\'ll get "near perfect play and some luck" six or seven games in a row against other skilled generals to actually win a top spot?\\n "

These countries, especially India should rethink their relationship with Iran and cooperate with the sanctions.

It does prove to anyone objective person or nation who had any doubts previously that the Iranian Regime is engaged in lies and deception, both in their involvement in terrorism and concerning their Nuclear Program."

"i\\'m directing this comment only to the my fellow chelsea supporters.\\n\\ni for once agree with AVB. I think he should be strict with these big name players. If you are manager of this team you need to be strict. Avram Grant was too soft. Scolari too soft. Ancelotti in his 2nd year too soft. Are they still our manager... no. By time we have a manager that does things his own way and not play to their tune. At least he can (if he is sacked) say he did things his way, unlike the other scared managers afraid to touch drogba, anelka, lampard and Terry. Too long have these "big personality" players rule Chelsea. Remember in the 3rd season of Jose\\'s reign when we lost the league to untd, early that season Drogba wanted to leave as he was sulking most of the champions previous 2 years and after Jose left, he sulked even more causing lot of negativity in the camp. OH and remember the champs final the sent off AND ANELKA\\'S MISSED PENALTY????? then the next year Scolari became manager he sulked even more and caused again negativity in the team. my point is when he doesn\\'t sulk we win things. Players like Drogba, Malouda, Anelka, Lampard and Terry get paid lots of money per week to be professional and to give their best. CLEARLY AND THEIR SHOULD BE NO ARGUAMENTS FROM CHELSEA SUPPORTERS WHEN I SAY NONE OF THESE PLAYERS THIS YEAR ARE PERFORMING WELL ENOUGH TO BE IN 1ST TEAM YET THEY ARE DEMANDING FIRST TEAM ACTION. MALOUDA IS A WAISTE OF TIME, MONEY AND A PLACE IN THE TEAM. If this was Sir Alex instead of AVB then Man untd fans would have supported him, i\\'m asking, can we not do the same with AVB. I\\'m a big fan of Jose, but i think AVB is perfect for Chelsea as soon as the older players leave in the summer we will see the true CHELSEA.. We are set to buy Willian, Hazard, Christensen and Neymar. Players such as Paizon coming through next season. IMAGINE THE FOLLOWING SQUAD FOR NEXT SEASON.\\n\\n                                      TORRES - STURRIDGE- NEYMAR\\n\\nMATA  -  ESSIEN- ROMEU -   RAMIREZ - PAIZON -MEIRELES -  HAZARD WILLIAN\\n\\n                                     COLE- CAHILL-TERRY-LUIZ-IVANOVIC\\n\\n                                                           CECH\\n\\ncome on i know you are smiling as a chelsea fan and i know you are worried as a non chelsea fan.

"Ten Reasons Why Gay Marriage is Wrong\\n\\n01) Being gay is not natural. Real Americans always reject unnatural things like eyeglasses, polyester, and air conditioning.\\n02) Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.\\n03) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.\\n04) Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are still property, blacks still can't marry whites, and divorce is still illegal.\\n05) Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were allowed; the sanctity of Britany Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage would be destroyed.\\n06) Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn't be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren't full yet, and the world needs morechildren.\\n07) Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children.\\n08) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours,the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America.\\n09) Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to raise children.\\n10) Gay marriage will change the foundation of society; we could never adapt to new social norms. Just like we haven't adapted to cars, the service-sector economy, or longer life spans."

"So I guess all the person had to do in the article was bitch constantly about a game that so many people have bitched about for ages and then they win the bitches over? Wow. As far as "Stop trivializing violence" goes. Why dont you stop sounding like a big ass c*** sucker and don\\'t play games with violence then. I get so tired of all these holy sounding types that get touchy about video game violence.\\n\\n I\\'ve seen Blood Diamond a dozen times with the kids killing and getting killed and it doesn\\'t even phase me one bit only because its not real, sure there is an emotional sense there but not enough to make me write to Hollywood saying gay sh*t like Stop trivializing violence because its disgusting. Why does a game have to tone it down when movies don\\'t? I\\'m not defending COD in the slightest, and that\\'s because I don\\'t really care about the game. But when I read the headline of the article I was curious to see what others were going to say, but I knew hands down it was going to be an attempt to throw punches at a series that has sold a lot of copies already. All I can say is, it doesn\\'t matter how "YOU" feel when every other gamer that plays the game probably can just deal with the game no matter if it changes or not.\\n\\n Sitting on your overgrown ass complaining about a game being this and being that just because you don\\'t like it is stupid as hell. I hate JRPG games and why I also hate Anime with a passion because I can\\'t stand cute crap, I hate that overly sensitive BS with the characters, I don\\'t like Japanese music either unless its instrumental War drums or something out of Samurai Warriors or Kessen where it doesn\\'t begin and end with a stupid Asian chick trying to sound like shes an innocent little annoying 11 or 13 year old...I hate high pitch whiny sounding voices too and no Japanese voice acting does not mean better over American voice acting because it still sucks regardless. \\n\\nBut I don\\'t go near the stuff (even though my brother plays JRPG games a lot, and that means I can\\'t really escape it when we\\'re both in the same room and I\\'m studying while he\\'s just playing his sissy games). The fact still stands that I don\\'t INTENTIONALLY go near things I hate just so I can whine about hating it like COD haters constantly go near Call of Duty to claim that they hate the game when its easier to just simply stay away from it, don\\'t buy it, try to pretend like it doesn\\'t even exist. I will not lie to anybody. I like violence in my games. People that walk around with a d*ck up there ass crying foul about CGI characters dying and getting hurt probably scream when the doctor comes at them with a needle. As far as Call of Duty having to change goes. Well, that depends on whether or not a lot of people want it to change, and not just the people that bash the game on a consistent basis either. I\\'m talking about people that really feel or believe it should change a few things and have accurate reasons why. Just simply saying "COD is for 13 year olds and needs to change this or that"...If anything the COD players are the ones that should change."

"I am a sales arborist in the DC Metro area. I have grown all too accustomed to the status quo set by Service Magic. As a credentialed and educated professional in my field it has become quite disturbing to work with the environment that Service Magic has created, i.e. a false sense of qualification of vendors to the consumer. I have spoken with many arborists from other firms in our region and all say the same thing. This could have been a beneficial service, but without demanding proper insurance and credentials from its vendors it simply becomes a means for the unlicensed and uninsured vendors to gain business they are not qualified to perform. This also leaves the qualified professionals, such as myself, without a fair cost comparison to offer our clients. The fact of the matter is, companies pay tens of thousands of dollars a year for proper insurance, not to mention the cost of education to aquire proper credentials. Service Magic comes along and opens up an outlet for those who have not performed their due diligence in aquiring these necessary benchmarks to practice their craft to be solicited to the masses as "qualified vendors". It\\'s a shame and has become a menace to the integrity of my profession and those of us who have worked hard and payed countless dollars to make ourselves a true qualified vendor. My hope is that the people at Service Magic make immediate change in their qualification of vendors."

"Being gay is absolutely a choice - if it were not a choice, how do you explain the thousands of people who were in that lifestyle and have rejected it and become heterosexual?"
"The general population may be, but I think that the people in the NAR know exactly what is in there, and are advocating for it. These are the same people who think gays should be executed, atheists should have their citizenship revoked, and that the first amendment means you have the freedom to choose what type of Christian you want to be. They say they want to return us to a "Christian Nation" and that we need to base our laws on Old Testament Biblical Law. Go back and look at some of the stuff Bryan Fischer, Mike Huckabee, Michele Bachmann, and Sarah Palin have both said and endorsed. Look at some of the statements Rick Perry\\'s advisers have made, and things Jim DeMint has said. They feel they have been commanded to take over government, the entertainment industry, the church, etc. \\xc2\\xa0These people have more influence than they should, and enough to be dangerous. Their followers are probably naive when it comes to what their leaders are advocating and will continue to push their agenda without considering the consequences. Some of the Tea Party have tried to introduce legislation to pass personhood amendments (which are bad enough) but also to charge women with felony murder if they miscarry but are unable to prove they had nothing to do with it. I have no idea how they would go about autopsying an 8 week old fetus, but women would be guilty until proven innocent. Please see last part of post in regards to capital punishment. This is what DeMint and crew advocate. These people are dangerous, and over 45% of the House of Representatives either actively endorse, or are sympathetic, to these nuts:\\n\\n\\nhttp://blog.christianitytoday.com/ctpolitics/2011/02/evangelicals_an_1.html\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nFor some fun reading, here are some links: "prenatal murder"\\xc2\\xa0\\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/02/26/georgia-lawmakers-anti-abortion-proposal-punish-women-miscarriages/\\n\\nall sorts of craziness linked on this website:\\xc2\\xa0\\nhttp://www.rightwingwatch.org/\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nhttp://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/08/14/dominionism-michele-bachmann-and-rick-perry-s-dangerous-religious-bond.html\\xc2\\xa0\\nhttp://www.theocracywatch.org/biblical_law2.htm\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nhttp://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v08n1/chrisre1.html\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nCapital PunishmentEpitomizing the Reconstructionist idea of Biblical "warfare" is the centrality of capital punishment under Biblical Law. Doctrinal leaders (notably Rushdoony, North, and Bahnsen) call for the death penalty for a wide range of crimes in addition to such contemporary capital crimes as rape, kidnapping, and murder. Death is also the punishment for apostasy (abandonment of the faith), heresy, blasphemy, witchcraft, astrology, adultery, "sodomy or homosexuality," incest, striking a parent, incorrigible juvenile delinquency, and, in the case of women, "unchastity before marriage."According to Gary North, women who have abortions should be publicly executed, "along with those who advised them to abort their children." Rushdoony concludes: "God\\'s government prevails, and His alternatives are clear-cut: either men and nations obey His laws, or God invokes the death penalty against them." Reconstructionists insist that "the death penalty is the maximum, not necessarily the mandatory penalty." However, such judgments may depend less on Biblical Principles than on which faction gains power in the theocratic republic. The potential for bloodthirsty episodes on the order of the Salem witchcraft trials or the Spanish Inquisition is inadvertently revealed by Reconstructionist theologian Rev. Ray Sutton, who claims that the Reconstructed Biblical theocracies would be "happy" places, to which people would flock because "capital punishment is one of the best evangelistic tools of a society."The Biblically approved methods of execution include burning (at the stake for example), stoning, hanging, and "the sword." Gary North, the self-described economist of Reconstructionism, prefers stoning because, among other things, stones are cheap, plentiful, and convenient. Punishments for non-capital crimes generally involve whipping, restitution in the form of indentured servitude, or slavery. Prisons would likely be only temporary holding tanks, prior to imposition of the actual sentence.""

"They is one".\n\nBut we would have to decide who we want to deliver the petition to, and that shapes the wording of the\xa0\nAnd it would be good to consult with a few other key people. \xa0We would not need to have unanimity, but we would need to know if "Syrian Campaigns" and others are thinking of doing the same thing. \xa0The situation now in Syria is such, so close to the tipping point, that every little project can help leverage the collapse of the regime.That is why I signed the petition to refer Assad to the ICC, even though I would prefer to simply lynch him in the streets of Damascus and display his body in every town of the land. \xa0Just my initial thoughts.\xa0Grammar pickers please note that I used the modal subjunctive "would" and "could", to indicate possibility, not fact."

"@jsdavis13 True. You'd think that the Christians who are so hell bent into forcing religion into public life would be using it to do the things Jesus talked about. He never said a word about gays or when the soul enters the body. He spent all of his time hanging out with prostitutes and the poorest of the poor telling rich people it would be very hard for them to get into heaven. Remember the sermon about when I was hungry you did not feed me, because what you do for the least of these you also do unto me? I don't much think Jesus cares how we care for each other, as long as we do. A hungry kid doesn't care if dinner came from food stamps or from a loving donation. My guess is he would not think highly of a society that leaves issues like hunger and medical care to the whims of its donor class."

"Great Scott\\nStephen F. Hayes\\nFebruary 20, 2012, Vol. 17, No. 22\\n\\nThroughout the 2012 election cycle Republicans have pined for a bold, conservative reformer\\xe2\\x80\\x94a leader courageous enough to make difficult choices and articulate enough to explain them to a skeptical public. The good news is they have such a candidate. The less good news: Scott Walker isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t running for president. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s running to hang on to his job as governor of Wisconsin.\\n\\nWalker is the target of a recall effort funded by national labor unions. Why? Reforms he made to balance the budget have dramatically diminished the influence of public employee unions. If not reversed, these reforms will inspire similar efforts across the country, and the outsized power of public sector unions will finally be reined in.\\n\\nThe election in Wisconsin\\xe2\\x80\\x94which will happen in late spring or summer\\xe2\\x80\\x94could have a profound impact on the 2012 presidential race, with the winning side emerging from the battle organized and energized in one of the most important swing states this November.\\n\\nWalker came to office in the Republican wave of 2010. He inherited a mess. Under his profligate predecessor, Jim Doyle, state government had operated almost as a slush fund for public employee unions. Giveaways to teachers and others put the state on an unsustainable fiscal path, so Doyle raised some taxes and threatened to raise others. He raided a state fund set up to cover medical liability, essentially stealing contributions doctors had made to the pooled account. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled against that pilfering, but the money had already been spent. Even after budget gimmickry that would make Fannie and Freddie blush, the official deficit was $3.6 billion.\\n\\nJust over a year later, Walker and the Republicans in the state legislature have nearly eliminated the deficit. For the two-year budget cycle, the state will show a $143 million shortfall because the stagnant economy has resulted in lower tax receipts than had been projected. But the shortfall is for the first half of the cycle; Wisconsin will run a surplus in the current fiscal year. And Walker said last week that he will eliminate the remaining shortfall without raising taxes. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a credible claim. He reduced the deficit without raising taxes. In fact, one of his first moves upon being sworn in was to cut taxes on businesses. His subsequent reforms have allowed property tax receipts to go down for the first time in years\\xe2\\x80\\x94by some $47 million.\\n\\nThe recall vote Walker faces comes because of these results. The key to his success was his restructuring of health and retirement benefits for many state employees, asking them to contribute 5.8 percent of their salary to their pensions (up from 1 percent or less) and to pay 12.6 percent of their health insurance premiums (up from 6 percent or so).\\n\\nEven some of the governor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s harshest critics acknowledged that such changes were reasonable. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWalker is right about one thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wrote Eugene Robinson, liberal columnist for the Washington Post. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen it comes to pensions and benefits, public workers in Wisconsin have a sweet deal. .\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xe2\\x80\\x89.\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xe2\\x80\\x89. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to see why the average private-sector worker in Wisconsin\\xe2\\x80\\x94probably paying upward of 25 percent toward health insurance costs and struggling to tuck away something, anything for retirement\\xe2\\x80\\x94might agree with Walker.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWalker understood from his years as Milwaukee County Executive that such changes could not occur without dramatic reforms of collective bargaining for public employee unions. So he proposed them, and Republicans in the state legislature made them law. The reforms also ended compulsory union membership.\\n\\nThe unions correctly understood these changes as a mortal threat. Without compulsory membership, unions would lose a major source of funds. And without the ability to bargain collectively for benefits, the unions would lose their most compelling argument to convince public employees to contribute a chunk of their income\\xe2\\x80\\x94in many cases more than $1,000 per year\\xe2\\x80\\x94for the privilege of membership. So they took to the streets in massive numbers and pressured the Democrats they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d elected to do everything possible to sabotage Walker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan. Democrats in the state senate fled to Illinois. Protesters occupied the state capitol. The fight captured national attention for months in 2011.\\n\\nThe unions lost that battle, but they did not give up the war. They launched an aggressive effort to recall several Republicans in the state senate with the hope of reversing the reforms before it became clear that they were working. They spent heavily\\xe2\\x80\\x94an estimated $30 million\\xe2\\x80\\x94and lost again.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the results of the changes began coming in. In Milwaukee, the reforms saved some $11 million, an embarrassing windfall for Democratic mayor Tom Barrett, who had predicted that the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s structural deficit would \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexplode.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Localities across the state have seen similar savings. There is no disputing the central fact of Walker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tenure as governor: His reforms are working.\\n\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a huge problem for the public employee unions as they try to convince Wisconsinites that the man responsible for this dramatic turnaround should be recalled. So they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re focusing on two other issues: his 2010 campaign and an investigation into the activities of former Walker employees.\\n\\nTheir first complaint is that Walker didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t campaign on the specific changes he would make to collective bargaining. Walker concedes that there is some truth to the claim. He wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t more specific, he says today, because he did not yet know exactly how he would make the changes to collective bargaining. But Walker is conceding too much. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t provide a point-by-point proposal to restrict collective bargaining, but it was no mystery that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d make dramatic changes. Ryan Murray, a top policy adviser to Walker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2010 campaign, made that clear to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in describing the changes to public employee health and retirement benefits. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe way the proposal would work is we would take the choice out of the collective bargaining process,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said in comments published on August 29, 2010.\\n\\nDid that mean an end to collective bargaining over benefits? The reporter certainly seemed to think so. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[Murray] said school districts often have some of the most expensive health benefits in Wisconsin and could receive cheaper insurance through the state if they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to negotiate with unions about who would insure their members.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Christina Brey, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the leading teachers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 union, had the same understanding. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur members oppose taking away their rights to collective bargaining, so they would definitely raise their voices against it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Another teachers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 union, the American Federation of Teachers, distributed flyers to its members warning that Walker would \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvoid parts of labor contracts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94something that couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen without changes to collective bargaining laws.\\n\\nIn light of the success of Walker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reforms, complaining about what he said in 2010 seems unlikely to win many votes. So Walker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opponents want to change the subject. Last week, Mike Tate, chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic party, toured the state in an attempt to link Walker more closely to an investigation of some of his former employees. Here again, Democrats have resorted to distorting reality in order to smear Walker.\\n\\nThere are two separate issues. In the first, a woman who worked for Walker when he was Milwaukee County executive was found posting political comments on the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s website during working hours. She resigned in May 2010.\\n\\nThe second involves two former Walker employees who allegedly stole money from a veterans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 organization that worked with the county on an event held at the Milwaukee County Zoo. John Chisholm, Milwaukee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s district attorney, has been investigating the claims for 20 months. There is no indication Walker knew about the employees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 activities, much less condoned them. Chisholm has said that Walker is not a target of the investigation\\xe2\\x80\\x94which only exists because Walker requested it when he was presented with the facts.\\n\\nSome Wisconsin Republicans, pointing out that Chisholm is a Democrat and highlighting the steady stream of leaks coming from his office, are growing concerned that the investigation is a political witch hunt, designed to bloody the governor before voters cast their ballots. Walker, for his part, says that he believes Chisholm is an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cearnest\\xe2\\x80\\x9d prosecutor who will conduct a fair investigation. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably overly generous.\\n\\nThe coming battle for Wisconsin will be a difficult fight for Republicans. Democrats have shown that they are willing to do just about anything to win. Unions are fighting this battle as if their very existence depends on a victory\\xe2\\x80\\x94and it might.\\n\\nFor conservatives, the fight is about much more than one man in one state. A Walker defeat would send a message that political courage does not pay and political thuggery does. Walker doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like to talk about the effect the past year has had on him and his family, but it hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been pleasant. He has been subjected to numerous death threats. His wife, Tonette, has been verbally assaulted more times than she can count. His two teenaged boys have been targeted on Facebook. His modest home in Wauwatosa has been the site of several union protests. Last month, a protester outside Walker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s State of the State speech told State Senator John Kleefisch that his wife, Lieutenant Governor Rebecca Kleefisch, is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cf\\xe2\\x80\\x94ing whore.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWalker has been willing to endure these attacks to turn his state around and defend conservative principles. Conservatives should rally behind him.\\n"

"....From: Rogers v. Bellei, 401 U. S. 815, 831-3 (1971) [CONTINUED]\n.....\n "There are at least intimations in the decided cases that a dual national constitutionally may be required to make an election. In Perkins v. Elg, 307 U. S. 325, 307 U. S. 329 (1939), the Court observed that a native-born citizen who had acquired dual nationality during minority through his parents' foreign naturalization abroad did not lose his United States citizenship "provided that, on attaining majority, he elects to retain that citizenship and to return to the United States to assume its duties." In Kawakita v. United States, 343 U.S. at 343 U. S. 734, the Court noted that a dual national, "under certain circumstances," can be deprived of his American citizenship through an Act of Congress. In Mandoli v. Acheson, 344 U. S. 133, 344 U. S. 138 (1952), the Court took pains to observe that there was no statute in existence imposing an election upon that dual nationality litigant.\n\nThese cases do not flatly say that a duty to elect may be constitutionally imposed. They surely indicate, however, that this is possible, and, in Mandoli, the holding was based on the very absence of a statute, and not on any theory of unconstitutionality. And all three of these cases concerned persons who were born here, that is, persons who possessed Fourteenth Amendment citizenship; they did not concern a person, such as plaintiff Bellei, whose claim to citizenship is wholly, and only, statutory.""

The community simply decided, to turn thier back when ever he appeared, close thier pubs, stores, once he pulled up. 'Shunned' Thus the word 'boycott' enter the english language. The point, if you feel that strongly, organize a society response to his films and other work, independent of it's intrinsic qualities. \\nHere in Brazil, there is a culture of deflowering teens and preteen girls, by the nationals here, for foreigners they are sent to prison.\\nThis is often done by fathers and grandfathers, the patriarch of the family. Said to have originated in ancient Rome, the film BraveHearth made reference to first night, where the lord of the area do some form of this power sex on minors in thier dominion. West Virginia, comes to mind, as this power sex folklore is said to be in epidemic proportions, these daughters get deflowered in house, first, sound familia. Are you going to 'boycitt' the state of West Virginia? \\nClearly Morgan has crossed the lines, of our sensibilities, our Puritan morals, and our expectation of decency, so did George W. Bush,  with his Hurricane Catrina etc., and Bill Clinton with his oval office dick sucking, episode of his intern.\\nThese are/were  actual Presidents of these united States.

Obama can blow smoke up the publics skirt all he want to but the S&P and other credit agencies are not going to be fooled in the least. They've already warned of another downgrade and why?

"Additional thoughts based on other people's info:\n\n1. I kind of agree with the being a SmackDown star thought though eventually I think Bryan should have a legit shot at the title. Maybe just blatantly move him to Raw, so he can. And please don't mention Tensai. The guy is not ready to challenge Punk for the title and hopefully never will be,\n\n2. Ew, Big Show? Even when I used to despise Show for his booking, I would never say ew. Seriously, who says that?\n\n3. None of you guys really pointed out the fact that this is only falling in line for Jericho. He won't come back immediately. He is touring with Fozzy now and will be gone a lot of the summer. The only one who is hurt is Orton who we get to right afterwards.\n\n4. Wait, why are we talking about two newcomers getting their very first PPV match against the face of SmackDown? Sandow and Cesaro are not at a point that they should be wrestling against Orton. Miz would be a good choice if he weren't falling so far and so fast lately. I stand by Ziggler or Judas' idea of having Orton be the special guest referee.\n\n5. Raw had at least the Punk/Bryan segment. Also, when you say there is no tag team division, you seem to miss the fact that the division is in full rebuild right now. Everyone from the Usos to Darren Young and Titus O'Neil to Hawkins and Reks to the AW stable is stepping up and finding a place. In fact, the least fluid team right now might be the champions who still don't feel like a real tag team or a serious threat. As far as SmackDown vs. Impact, I agreed with the guys on Impact, but you guys are sometimes underscoring SmackDown which was very solid story-wise and especially wrestling-wise.\n\n6. Yeah, obvious the TNA move was positive while the Raw move is polarizing.\n\n7. Wow, a lot of Hogan lovers. "He made the show better." "Best mic work of his career." What? Hogan was great on the mic in the 80s and 90s. He has not improved. He has lost his wits and charisma for the most part. Laurinaitis plays his role to perfection, and he brought about the great Extreme Rules PPV. He is a long term storyline, taking over the company one step at a time. Hogan has not improved programming. The creative team has just come up with a couple good ideas since Hogan arrived. Sorry, but at least Laurinaitis doesn't have an easy replacement.\n\n8. Btw, Sean, you aren't ahead of me anymore. I went for a perfect 20 at Over the Limit putting me in clear first. Second, I see some of your points, and Shelley could work. I just think Morgan has to be the choice now. It could end up being wrong, but Shelley is a much less safe and much more long term choice.\n\n9. I stick by what I said. Sting shouldn't be wrestling any more. He doesn't have the skill or the presence he once had. He is just a symbol being hopelessly dragged around by TNA desperately.\n\n10. Wait, so no Angle then? Then it will probably be Sting. If not, people need to realize that Roode has feuded with Hardy already. He has feuded with Styles already. Basically, that means it is someone fresh like Austin Aries or Samoa Joe. Or it's Anderson who has been built to it. So I guess I'll say I hope it's Anderson over Sting, but it will probably be Sting."

"From: Rogers v. Bellei, 401 U. S. 815, 831-3 (1971)(a case involving statutory citizenship forfeiture, discussing dual citizenship/dual allegiance):\n\n"The Congress has an appropriate concern with problems attendant on dual nationality. Savornan v. United States, 338 U. S. 491, 338 U. S. 500 (1950); N. Bar-Yaacov, Dual Nationality xi and 4 (1961). These problems are particularly acute when it is the father who is the child's alien parent and the father chooses to have his family reside in the country of his own nationality. The child is reared, at best, in an atmosphere of divided loyalty. We cannot say that a concern that the child's own primary allegiance is to the country of his birth and of his father's allegiance is either misplaced or arbitrary.\n\nThe duality also creates problems for the governments involved. MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN recognized this when, concurring in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 372 U. S. 187 (1963), a case concerning native-born citizens, he observed: "We have recognized the entanglements which may stem from dual allegiance. . . ." In a famous case, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS wrote of the problem of dual citizenship. Kawakita v. United States, 343 U. S. 717, 343 U. S. 723-736 (1952). He noted that "[o]ne who has a dual nationality will be subject to claims from both nations, claims which at times may be competing or conflicting," id. at 343 U. S. 733; that one with dual nationality cannot turn that status "into a fair-weather citizenship," id. at 343 U. S. 736; and that "[c]ircumstances may compel one who has a dual nationality to do acts which otherwise would not be compatible with the obligations of American citizenship," ibid.\n ....

HOWEVER, the USDA has a long history of CAUSING THOSE PROBLEMS, not ending them. I think this practice is foul and untrustworthy, like all government/police-state practices this country is adopting. And yet yes, parents need to wake up and step up their game if they want their kids to outlive them.....since this is the first generation that isn't expected to. And that is in large part due to diet and lifestyle, two things parents have 100% control over.

A double drowned caddis will also work.\n.. Down canyon on the Gibbon River you will have to look for protected water, and gentle feeding lanes. There is a bit more color, the discharge is up, and the fish are being very picky about where they are hanging out. On the other hand they are not picky at all about what they are eating. \n\nOn the other hand, for a change, the Firehole River, (after an early scare,) has enjoyed cooling melt water and has maintained a bank-full puddle so far.\n\nhttp://flyfishyellowstone.blogspot.com/"
