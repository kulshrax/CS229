I really am. What happens in your life, in your car and in your marriage should not be a public issue. Unfortunately, because you are a public figure, sometimes your private life does become public. I guess it comes with the territory and maybe you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re used to it by now. It still must bite, though......Of course I long for you to own your mistakes, Tiger. If you aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t already, and I hope you are, man up to the pain you caused your wife and family. Let the hot searing anger she has for what you did change you, not harden you. It must be a hard road to walk, both for her dealing with what you have done, and for you, making sense of where to go from here when you are in the public eye the way you are. Stand behind your actions by way of fully admitting and acknowledging them to yourself. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lie to yourself or pretend they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t as bad as others think or that somehow you were justified. You weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. You are reaping what you sowed, Tiger. Own it. But see, whether you acknowledge all that publicly to your fans is entirely up to you. It makes no difference to me if your public apologies are detailed or not. For it is not us you need to be apologizing to. Because you are well known does not make you accountable to the public. Share only what you want, and keep the rest private. Keep it all private, if you can. But, and I speak from painful experience here, coming entirely clean does feel good. Really good....\\n\\nTonight, I am praying for restoration for your marriage. Having almost lost mine, because of my own sin and pride as well as that of my husband, I now hold redemption in marriage in such high regard....But my advice, as someone who has been there? Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hide it. Own it. Embrace it. Learn from it. Change your ways. Feel repentance. Apologize to your wife. Seek counseling, lots of it if you can. Let the searing pain and guilt and remorse you hopefully feel inspire in you to see yourself for what you are: A wretched sinner in need of forgiveness.\\n\\nYou, your heart, and that of your wife and children are what matter. Focus on them, on saving your marriage, if that is what you want to do. And truly, my husband and I pray that it is what you want to do."\\n\\n"

Unless Paterno didn\\'t care? Paterno is just as much to blame..was his stupid decision to let the man back on campus after a D.A. was investigating and continuing to investigate Sandusky up until 2005 when the D.A. went missing and is presumed DEAD (oh and his laptop and hard drive were destroyed too...can you say cover up?!!"

"Posted at 08:45 AM ET, 06/07/2012\nObama is killing the Democratic Party\nBy Jennifer Rubin\n\nPresident Obama, I have frequently argued, has been fabulous for the conservative movement. He spurred the creation of the tea party. He helped the GOP win the House majority in 2010 and make big gains in the Senate. His Obamacare has helped revive the Commerce Clause and given a boost to conservative jurisprudence. His refusal to support human rights has caused a bipartisan revulsion and reminded us that foreign policy must be girded by American values. He\u2019s sent independents running into the GOP\u2019s arms. He\u2019s forced conservatives to think hard and express eloquently principles of religious liberty, limited government, free markets and Constitutional democracy.\n\nObama also has wreaked havoc in the the Democratic Party. He\u2019s firmly affixed the \u201ctax and spend\u201d label to it after Bill Clinton declared that the era of big government was over. He\u2019s made Clinton into a pitch man for Mitt Romney.

"The "wedge Issue" isn\\'t whether women use birth control. \\xc2\\xa0The issue is Obama\\'s continued and frequent and deliberate abuse of the Constitution. \\xc2\\xa0It is one more example of his utter willingness to destroy the principles in our founding document so that he can dictate to the populace as he sees fit. \\xc2\\xa0He has shown all too often that he cares not for the First Amendment, especially if anyone uses it to speak against his policies - they are attacked, branded racist, labeled as unintelligent. \\xc2\\xa0He does not respect the Second Amendment (one of the best protections against both criminals and overweening government power). \\xc2\\xa0He cares not for the 10th Amendment, because he excoriates the states for exercising powers delegated to them by the Constitution - that of Arizona to protect its own borders and its budget; that of Texas to draw its electoral districts; the right of states to control their own budgets on a wide range of issues. \\xc2\\xa0He does not respect the 14th Amendment if it means enforcing statutes against blacks who violate them, such as the infamous Chicago voting rights case; or the directive by his Dept. of Education to colleges and universities to reduce the legal standards of proof for finding of rape and sexual assault when brought against a male, so that a man\\'s career can be ruined on sayso even when a police investigation shows the accuser to be lying; or his Dept. of Just-Us "Guidance Memorandum" that allows colleges and universities to (wink, wink) substitute the term "critical mass" for "quotas" and throw clear law into the trashcan while pursuing racial preferences. \\xc2\\xa0He does not believe in the right to contract guaranteed by Article I of the Constitution - note his "giving" labor unions position ahead of stockholders and bondholders in the grants to Chrysler and GM. \\xc2\\xa0Note his efforts to curtail what companies pay their executives - a matter for stockholders who own those companies, not the government.\\n\\nAnother issue is his apparent belief that the public is incredibly stupid. \\xc2\\xa0His "compromise" on the birth control requirement for Catholic institutions simply means that the overall rates for health insurance will be raised for those institutions to pay for both the administrative costs of "outreach" as well as for the birth control devices - including abortifacients such as the "morning after" pill. \\xc2\\xa0Nothing is free, but one would never know it by looking at his "budgets.""

"How A CSM Works. \n   After a hand is over the cards just used are placed back into the shuffler to be mixed with the other cards in the shoe. Shuffle Master\u2019s King uses an elevator system to randomize the cards. As the elevator is moved up and down, cards are randomly inserted into one of the 19 shelves in the elevator. The shuffler randomly selects a shelf of cards to deliver into the shoe. Because of the non-linear process, every discard re-inserted following a hand has a chance of appearing in the next round.   Although Shuffle Master says The King differs from their competitors continuous shufflers because the others use a linear design most CSMs so the same thing. They put the discards back into play and does away with the dealers having to stop to physically shuffle the cards at the end of a shoe. \nThe House Edge    The continuous shufflers have no benefits for the player and has been dubbed the "uncomfortable shoes". It eliminates card counting for the skilled player and will also have a major disadvantage for the basic strategy player. It speeds up the game! \nWhen the CSM was first introduced many players felt it would probably increase the house edge. As it turns out this is not entirely true. Michael Shackleford, The Wizard of Odds did a mathematical analysis of the Continuous Shuffling Machines and found that there was a very slight reduction in the house edge. \nIn a four deck game the edge is 0.034 percent and in an eight deck game is tis0.014 percent. Before you get excited about a slight reduction in the house edge you have to realize that when the casino uses a CSM the speed of the games is increased by about 20 percent. The basic strategy player stands to lose more in the long run because they are exposing more money to the house edge. \nAs a player I feel it\u2019s a treat to visit a casino that offers double and single deck games. I would hate to see these games eliminated altogether. Even a multi deck shoe game is preferable to the Continuous Shuffling Machines. The best way you can let the casinos know this is by refusing to play Blackjack at the casinos that use a CSM for their Blackjack games"

Alls I know is although I thoroughly disagree with the absolute abolition of religion, its very obvious that we have to find a way to evolve our thought processes. \nOh, and as far as movie related articles are concerned, Scientology is famously a very big force in the entertainment industry, as many of the big name A-list actors follow that faith.

"From what I can see, most men like women who are physically fit.  You don't have to look like a runway model, but YOU DO need to look like you take care of yourself, eat reasonably well, and exercise.  Studies have shown (though I'm referencing information I read YEARS ago) that WM actually prefer a larger body type than WW, but not as large as BM or HM.  WW seem to want to be a size zero, while WM seem to like the athletic Swedish model body.  Anyway, I think both of the ladies above look very attractive.  However, I don't understand this fixation on having butts and thighs that are WAY out of proportion with the rest of one's figure.  That isn't attractive to me, personally.  I just don't get it.  And, seeing a HUGE rear on a small girl just doesn't make any sense.  I don't know how it's physically possible to have skinny arms, legs, waist, and still have a humongous derriere and/or thighs.  Many men like a nice-sized butt, including WM and AM (I know from experience), so a BW's full, round bottom isn't necessarily a problem for men in general.  But, MOST men (including BM) don't want a bottom that's so obese it looks like it's own planet.  Get and stay in shape for your own health and opportunities, BW."

"Define abortion in objective terms. Explain the whole process of abortions too me. Explain what you see in a sonogram of a baby with fingers, toes, fingerprints, eyes, a heartbeat and brainwaves. Explain late term abortions for me. Where they pull a baby's head out and inject it with saline and then vacuum their brains out. Pro choicers are cowards at the core. How brave of you to lay down your responsibilities for what you did at a nightclub getting drunk and having unprotected sex and then kill your living mistake. "

"So you don't actually care about making women feel welcome as part of your professional community, which is generally impossible for a woman living in a sexist society to do (this one) when attention is being drawn to how her colleagues see her as a sexual object. Why don't you just admit it and be honest? I would feel really refreshed if someone like you said, for once, "We don't want women in our field." It would look stupid and ridiculous -- since why would you throw away half the available talent just because you want to sexualize everything? -- but then we could actually discuss the real point instead of derailing, dismissive, prevaricating, and dissembling discourse of which this one is an excellent example."

No gay adoptions we need a man and a woman in these kids lives. Regardless of what liberal propaganda tells us, conservatives out number liberals 3 to 1 why do you think fox is so big and liberal radio shows are basically non existent. Why is it 85% of Americans were against Obama care and yet because of the majority in congress it was passed anyway? Conservatives need to get off their keesters. In Arizona these things are not radical, there mellow. Start working on making homosexuality illegal start far to the right just as the liberals start far to the left and they get it (Obama care etc.) no this is the conservative\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fault. Gay people need to feel shame in what their doing, not heroic as the liberal media makes them sound. Make it illegal and that will help in giving them the shame they should already feel. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just not right it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a matter of hate I guess I hate rapists to because I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right either.\\nIf we glorified rapists and made them sound all heroic would it become a RIGHT to be who they are? That's how they were born. They didn't choose to be that way they just are so they should have the RIGHT to rape any man woman child or animal. This is the liberal logic. Next their going to want to pass laws that being a rapist is just sexual orientation. You would even see ignorant people trying to say the bible says its ok. If it were ok then 2 men could have a baby without help from any women and 2 women could have a child without using any sperm from a man. Nope sorry just not possible. "

Newt has been spot on predicting where king hussein obama is leading us, including the attack on the church, which is simply the avenue to establish the legal precedent that the WH has the power to tell us - all of us - how to act, how to respond, and what to think!  That\\'s the real issue from obama and his henchwoman michellivelli!  Not only will rick be behind on tidal wave of rot that will flood him if elected, he will not be able to get congress to do a darn thing!  And when his failed 4 years are over, the demonic dems will come back to power with a vengence by simply pointing at rick\\'s miserable record and lack of ability to lead in a hail storm of enemies on both sides of him!  \\n\\nSo rick should just suck it up, stop whining and run the gauntlet like Newt has had to ... if he can\\'t stand the heat then he can\\'t lead the country!"

I feel it\\'s your duty to say where you stand in full transparency and to balance the press that SGK is getting for the opposite reason. If both opinions are not provided then only ONE opinion will be weighed. Readers deserve both. The difference is that you stood for yourself, not for Elisa or Jory. SGK leaders weren\\'t so transparent, they instead used the entire organization to front their personal mission.\\n\\n \\n\\nOur online "voice votes" carry far more weight than the political elections. Once women understand that, they\\'ll understand their responsibility to say what they think often, loudly, and with civility.\\n\\n \\n\\nI am very dismayed by SGK\\'s stand because it is playing to politics and not helping women. I will not be supporting SGK any longer. There are many places that are more focused in their mission to help all women, Planned Parenthood is one of them. When I was a starving college student, PP was my primary health screener. Later I did volunteer work at PP to pay back for my healthcare; one of the things we were trained on was how to check yourself for lumps and why it was important. They have been consistent in their mission to help all women stay alive and healthy often during the most dire of times."

"<strong>Whom the Gods Would Destroy</strong>\\n\\n \\nIt seems that<strong> Obama, in a classic act of hubris, has created the means of his own destruction.</strong>  Through his great historical contribution, his health care bill, he has struck what was surely<strong> intended to be a lethal blow against the oldest organization on earth -- an organization with something on the order of a billion members, with a cadre of hundreds of thousands of highly trained and dedicated personnel, and a history of overcoming political threats that make Obama look like a kindergartner.\\n\\nI\\'m referring, of course, to the Catholic Church</strong>.  Now, I don\\'t mean that the Archangel Gabriel will appear out of the East to scourge the administration with a blazing sword, though I would pay to see that.  What I\\'m saying is that <strong>Obama has at last taken the step that we all knew he had in him, the ultimate act of arrogance and contempt that will bring the forces of history down upon him.</strong>\\n\\nThe left has always underestimated the Catholic Church.  "<strong>How many divisions has the pope?" Stalin once asked Molotov, mocking the Church\\'s powerlessness in the modern era.  He was not around to see John Paul II rend the Bolshevik kingdom in twain at the climax of the Cold War, utilizing the only forces he required: moral certainty and absolute faith in the divine mission.</strong>  Most American leftists are a little different, viewing the Church as an anachronism, obsessed with medieval ideas having no place in the third millennium and populated with strange figures in outmoded clothing, if not with an endless parade of child-molesters.  \\n\\n<strong>What they overlook is two thousand years of history</strong>.  An organization does not survive for that length of time -- and no other organization has -- without internalizing things not completely understood by even the deepest thinkers among us.  <strong>\\n\\nThe Church survived the fall of Rome, the barbarians, the first Muslim upsurge, several schisms, the Renaissance princes, the 20th-century totalitarians, and its own plunges into decadence, and it will also survive modernism.</strong>  Which is in fact what it confronts in Obama: a man of vast though superficial sophistication and little insight who has punched all the tickets available to him in his epoch and culture and truly believes there is nothing else. <strong> And now this man, afraid of revealing his own college transcripts, thinks he can take on the Church of Peter, founded a millennium before the appearance of any nation now existing on this earth.</strong>\\n\\n\\nRead more: http://www.americanthinker.com/2012/02/whom_the_gods_would_destroy.html#ixzz1mKnbY0d3"

"Video: Breitbart vs. Cenk Uygar over rape at \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOccupy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d camps\\nposted at 9:52 pm on February 14, 2012 by Allahpundit\\n\\nVia Breitbart TV. I should have guessed that eventually we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be arguing over whether \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOccupy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d has a problem with crime, notwithstanding the long, long, long, long, long list of alleged criminal activities at the encampaments. Remember, things at Zuccotti Park got so bad that a women-only tent was set up so that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be strength in numbers against sexual predators. Some feminist sites criticized \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOccupy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for its rape problem back during the movement\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brief heyday; even HuffPo reported on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmultiple incidents of assault, drug dealing and drug use, rape and attempted rape, according to conversations with numerous protesters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Per Breitbart in the clip, that detail apparently didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make it into their book.) And of course, we only know about some of what went on. At least one \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOccupy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d camp reminded victims that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe do not encourage the involvement of the police in our community\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and a New York City cop told Big Journalism\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Joel Pollak that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are many incidents of sexual touching and groping that goes unreported to us, mainly because the alleged victim is either too stoned or high to properly ID them or they \\xe2\\x80\\x98dont want to get the guy in trouble.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Some national media outlets reported on the attacks too.) This is why, of course, Breitbart was yelling at the Occupiers outside CPAC to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstop raping people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but now that the movement is gearing up for a big spring comeback, I guess it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time for the left\\xe2\\x80\\x99s whitewash to being in earnest. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice bookend to their demagoguery over the Tucson shooting: In that case, tea partiers were blamed for a crime that no tea partier committed whereas here no Occupiers are blamed for a crime that quite a few Occupiers allegedly committed. Fourteen minutes, but well worth it.\\n\\nvideo\\n\\nhttp://hotair.com/archives/2012/02/14/video-breitbart-vs-cenk-uygar-over-rape-at-occupy-camps/"
