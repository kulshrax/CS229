Potential New Features:
ARUN (- start w/ bag of words and pick top 1000 words - try TF-IDF )

 - ARUN Fraction of nouns / verbs / adjectives, etc.
 	- NLTK PoS Tagging Module
 - STEPHANIE Fraction of misspelled things => falls out of bag of words
  	- NLTK SpellCheck Module

 - STEPANIE Sentiment analysis on individual words / bigrams, etc.
 	- Compute our own sentiment values based on the training data?
 	- OR should we use a pre-existing NLTK implementation's sentiment weights?
 - STEPHANIE Number of most positive / most negative words in this sample
 	- Based on above
 - DONE (MATT) Use the score generated from Naive Bayes (weigh this heavily)
 	- DONE (from previous work)



- MATT Set threshold to move along the precision-recall curve


- Hyperparam tuning:
	- Try with logarithmic values (1, 10, 100, etc.)
